    "# Getting data\n",
    "Getting nice data and making it computationallly usable often takes the lion's share of computational work. As a rule of thumb supplemental tables are less accessible than data provided by organizations, and organizations with long-term efforts provide data in the nicest way. One excellent source of data for biology is the National Libary of Medicine. Besides providing online versions of their tools such as Pubmed, you can also find most of their information on a server that allows you to download the underlying data. The web addres of this goldmine is: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\n",

    "For this tutorial we will \n",
    "- Get the names of the genes with the highest number of human GeneRIF statements (which is similar to our publication where we used PubMed). GeneRIF statements provide short paragraph on the function of genes. \n",
    "- We will further write a function that will display all GeneRIF statements for a gene of your interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need two files:\n",
    "- A table containing the names of human genes: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.gene_info.gz\n",
