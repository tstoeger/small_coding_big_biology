    "- You will learn <b>pandas</b> and <b>seaborn</b>, which are two libraries for python\n",

    "    - We will form groups consisting of 4 people per group\n",

    "    - We will then combine the code written by individual groups, and then jointly explore some hypotheses, e.g.: that orthologous genes are also studied in orthologous tissues\n",

    "## Download this tutorial\n",
    "Github, which stores the code for this tutorial, is used (and required by some journals) to exchange computational code. However, you can not execute code on github itself, and editing code on github is difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, you will need to download a copy of this code, and store it on your computer. Click the above link, https://github.com/tstoeger/small_coding_big_biology, and then click on the large green button that says \"Clone or download\" and download the code as a ZIP file to your desktop. In case that after the download you only see a ZIP file on the desktop, rather than a folder containing the individual files of the code of the tutorial, you will need to uncompress the ZIP file. On many computers this will be possible by double-clicking on the ZIP file.\n",

    "## Installing Anaconda\n",
    "You can think of Anaconda as a tool box. While you could also get those tools separately, it is much more convenient to know that the most needed tools will already be present and that they will work together. Some of the tools included in Anaconda are:\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "Before visiting the download page, be warned: There are two distinct versions of Anaconda, where each contains comparable tools. <font color=\"green\">Do download a version for Python 3</font>, <font color=\"red\">do not download a version for Python 2 </font> which is an old dialect of the Python language. With this in mind, go to the following page and download and subsequently install a Python 3 version: https://www.anaconda.com/download"
